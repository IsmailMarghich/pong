A pong game versus an AI made with Canvas, you can move your pad by moving the mouse.
The ball progressively gets faster, and whichever side scores 7 points first, wins.
This game is rendered using an animation function that redraws the entire canvas, this is kept smooth with the RequestAnimationFrame method.
